# AntiExecutor
Since a lot of server owners have been struggling to block executors for a long time, we have decided to release our private build anti-executor script to the public. With this script servers will be able to detect multiple executors, including but not limited to RedEngine and Eulen. 

INSTALLATION
- download and extract the files into your resources folder
- Configure your ban event and logs in the config.lua
- start the resource in your server.cfg ( always use ensure antiexecutor )
- restart your server and wave the cheaters goodbye!

We hope this script finds a good purpose. Sharing is always allowed, but keep the credits and original github link included when doing so.

Our christmas present to the FiveM community, happy holidays!
